<h2>CHARIVARIA</h2>.

  <p>WE envy the freshness of America's experience as a member of the
  Alliance. New York will hold its first flag day on June 2nd.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>America is anxious to see a settlement of the Irish Question, but
  there is no truth in the rumour that we have cabled to say that we will
  take on Mexico if America will take on Ireland.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>VON IHNE, the KAISER'S Court architect, is dead. It is thought that
  future alterations to the House of Hohenzollern will not reflect, as
  heretofore, the ALL-HIGHEST'S personal taste.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Stern measures for King Tino," says a contemporary. We have always
  felt that that is where the castigation should take place.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>The Daily Chronicle</i> reminds us that Downing Street owes its
  origin to an American. There are some people who never will let bygones
  be bygones.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Whole haystacks are said to have been eaten in a night by mice in
  Victoria, Australia. The failure of Mr. HUGHES to provide a state cat in
  each rural area may, it is thought, prove to be the deciding factor in
  the present election campaign.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The <i>Tageblatt</i> points out that in view of the extreme goodwill
  of Germany towards Spain that country cannot possibly find any grievance
  in the torpedoing of her ships. This assurance of uninterrupted
  friendliness has confirmed the worst fears of the pessimists in
  Madrid.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. BALFOUR, it is stated, has invited President WILSON to play a game
  of golf. In the event of a match being arranged there is a growing desire
  that the occasion should be made a half-holiday throughout the
  war-area.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Ministry of Shipping, it is stated, employs only 830 persons. This
  violent departure from the recognised Parliamentary rule, that a Minister
  who cannot find use for a couple of thousand employees should resign, has
  gone far to undermine the popularity of this Department.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Owing to the shortage of corn on which race-horses must be fed,
  ordinary handicaps will soon have to be abandoned. The idea of putting
  the horseradish to the use for which it was originally intended does not
  seem to have struck the imagination of trainers.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Director of Women's Service has issued an appeal for several
  thousand milkmaids. These must not be confused with milksops who are
  being taken care of by other Departments.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"I have heard more bad music at temperance meetings," says Dr.
  SALEEBY, "than I knew the world could contain." The temperance people are
  certainly having persistent bad luck.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The keenest minds in Germany, says a Berlin correspondent, are now
  seeking to discover the secret of the Fatherland's world-wide
  unpopularity. It is this absurd sensitiveness on the part of our cultured
  opponent that is causing some of her best friends in this country to lose
  hope.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A swallow has been seen over the Hollow Ponds at Epping Forest, but
  <i>The Daily Mail</i> is still silent as to whether Spring has arrived or
  not.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"New Laid Eggs," Sir JOHN MILLAIS' masterpiece, has recently been sold
  for £1,155. It is reported that last December, when it looked as if the
  egg might become extinct, a much higher price was offered for the
  picture.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In the absence of other grain, hens are to be fed upon frostbitten
  wheat imported from Canada. Poultry-keepers anticipate that it will
  result in a greatly increased number of china eggs being laid by their
  stock.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A correspondent of a morning paper complains that while the entire
  nation is on rations our Germans, naturalised and unnaturalised,
  "continue to eat in the usual way." This is not true of the ones we have
  heard.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In view of the excessive rains of late, we are glad to note that one
  organisation is not to be caught napping. The National Lifeboat
  Institution is fitting out its boats with a new life-belt.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The KAISER, it is reported, has written a play. It only needed this to
  convince us that he is quite himself again.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We also learn that he is once more on speaking terms with Count
  REVENTLOW. He told the COUNT, the other day, "to mind his own
  business."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>There were 1,084,289 visitors to the London Zoological Gardens last
  year. It is worthy of note that not one of them was accepted.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A wood-pigeon shot at Heytesbury was found to have in its crop
  sixty-five grains of corn&mdash;enough to produce half a sack of wheat.
  In fairness to the bird it is only right to say that it was not aware of
  this.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. BRACE has lately introduced a Bill in the House to reduce the
  number of jurors at inquests. A further improvement would be to repeal
  the old technicality which makes it illegal for a man to give evidence at
  his own inquest.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"I met the prisoner twenty years ago," said a witness in a Northern
  police court last week, "and I well remember his face." It is better to
  have that sort of memory than that sort of face.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>At a rally of five hundred boy scouts of London, Wolf Cubs greeted
  Cardinal BOURNE with the "Great Howl." It is not known in what way the
  CARDINAL had offended the young Cubs.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Under the new order the police will not have power to enter the
  premises of persons suspected of food hoarding. Cooks who in the past
  have been in the habit of hoarding cold rabbit pie will have to be dealt
  with in other ways.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to a Billingsgate fish merchant kippers are daily increasing
  in price. It is, of course, too much to hope that they will ever become
  so dear as to prohibit their use among comedians on the music-hall
  stage.</p>

<h2>GEMS FROM THE JUNIORS.</h2>

  <p>The following articles have been written by a little band of patriots
  who, without any hope of gain or self-aggrandisement, have poured forth
  of their store of wisdom and experience for the instruction, comfort and
  encouragement of their fellow-countrymen:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">THE BRITISH NAVY.</p>

  <p>We are all very proud of the Navy. It is the largest in the world and
  all the men in it are very brave, and kind too I expeck. ALFRED THE GREAT
  invented it hundreds of years ago so it has had a long time to practis
  in. When a sailer wants to say yes he says Ay, ay, sir, not offen mum
  because the captain is always a man. Perhaps some day he wont be. I have
  got an uncle who is a captain in the Navy. He says that in the olden days
  sailers had such bad food that it walked about and if it was up the other
  end of the table you ony had to whissel and it came down your end dubble
  quick. But I don't know if that is true. Anyhow everything is all rite
  now but this plesant thouhgt must not stop us sending parsels to the
  sailers, as you cant fish up cakes and apples out of the sea and they
  like them very much.</p>

<p class="center">SOLGIERS.</p>

  <p>Solgiers wear karki. If you are an offiser the others salut you if you
  arn't they don't. People musn't kill each other unless they have to becos
  it's rwong. Solgiers have to. They have to pollish there buttens as well.
  It is there cheef job unless they are offisers. Then they don't becos
  they get paid more and let some one else do it for them. Before the war
  solgiers were only one kind of man, now they are all kinds but mostly
  good. Granpa is a genral so he knows. A frend of fathers is a private, he
  is quite nice but he mayn't come to dinner when granpas here. I shall be
  a solgier when I grow up praps a genral but Im not sure. I would like to
  be someone with a sord and a drum. Granpa hasn't got a drum.</p>

<p class="author">DOUGLAS BAYSWATER (age 8).</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center">AMERICA.</p>

  <p>America is really the name of a continent but when we say America we
  mean the bit of it that used to belong to us. Americans do not have a
  king they used to have our King but they gave him up. It wasn't the King
  we have now or perhaps they wouldn't have. So they have someone called a
  President who does instead but he doesn't wear a crown and he only lasts
  a short time like the Lord Mare or a little longer. Besides the President
  there are men called millonares, they are normously rich and do insted of
  princes and dukes, who they haven't got either but not because they don't
  like them but because it is a Republic. Americans don't like war but if
  they have to fight they can do it all right Father says.</p>

<p class="center">OUR ALLIES.</p>

  <p>It is with great pleasure that I take up my pen to write about Our
  Allies. They are France, Belgium, Russia, Italy, Serbia, Portugal,
  Rumania, and America. I think thats all at present but eight is a good
  number. To begin with France. In time of peace the French are a gay and
  polite people which is very nice I think. They are noted for their coffee
  and for their fashions as both are better than ours. And all the women
  can cook. How beautiful it would be for England if she could imitate her
  sister country in these things! I can make a cake but not a very light
  one. Now let us look at Verdun on the map. It is a great fortress and the
  Germans thought they could take it but I rejoice to say they couldn't as
  the bravery and patrioticness of the French troops came in the way.
  Belgium is the next on the list. Belgium is a little country and Germany
  is a big one so of course the Germans had the best of it at first but
  they won't much longer. So it will be all right soon if we dont eat too
  many sweets and things. Russia, Italy, Serbia, Portugal, Rumania, America
  and Montynegro, which I forgot before, are all splendid countries but
  space forbids more.</p>

<h2>REVIVALS AND REVISIONS.</h2>

  <p>"IT" (as Mr. GOSSE says at the beginning of his fascinating monograph
  on SWINBURNE, a work which we understand has just been crowned by the
  Band of Hope) it is now beyond doubt that Mr. H.B. IRVING'S drastic way
  with <i>Hamlet</i> is to have a far-reaching effect on all revivals. New
  authors can be acted more or less as they write, or as they happen to be
  stronger or weaker than their "producers"; but to be revived is
  henceforward to be revised, and fairly stringently too.</p>

  <p>Mr. IRVING has made a clearance of certain parts of <i>Hamlet</i>
  which interfere with the movement of its story. Actuated by old-fashioned
  motives and writing for a public that was not yet wholly lacking in
  discrimination, SHAKSPEARE did his best to make <i>Hamlet</i> a poetical
  as well as a dramatic tragedy. With this end in view he accumulated the
  mass of rhetoric with which we are now so familiar. It as been Mr.
  IRVING's task to prune this well-meant but somewhat excessive verbiage so
  that the real dramatic stuff can at last "get over." But he has done no
  more. Any rumour to the effect that he has introduced American songs or
  dances, or that a "joy plank" bisects the stalls of the Savoy is untrue
  and deserves the severest denial.</p>

  <p>One of Mr. Punch's livest although middle-aged wires, who has been
  interviewing the great managers of the Metropolis&mdash;and by great he
  means those most likely to become revivalists&mdash;says that it is the
  same tale with all. For example, Mr. FRED TERRY, interviewed at his home
  near the Zoo, in his study furnished with the works of all the greatest
  writers, from the Baroness ORCZY to HAVELOCK ELLIS, admitted that it was
  perfectly true that he was contemplating a revival of <i>The Three
  Musketeers</i>, with certain alterations to bring it into line with
  modern taste in warrior heroes.</p>

  <p>"To-day," said Mr. TERRY, "as you may have noticed, soldiers wear
  khaki. Very well then, the musketeers shall wear khaki. They shall also
  be transformed into Englishmen and be made recognisable and friendly.
  Thus <i>D'Artagnan</i> will become an airman, <i>Aramis</i> a padre with
  fighting instincts, <i>Athos</i> a general, and <i>Porthos</i> an officer
  in the A.S.C. A certain amount of re-writing and adjusting is necessary,
  but that will come."</p>

  <p>In order to find Mr. GEORGE GROSSMITH, of the old firm of Grossmith
  and Laurillard, who is now, as all the world, and especially Germany,
  knows, a conning-tower of strength in the Navy, it is necessary to visit
  the North Sea; but Mr. Punch's middle-aged men stick at nothing.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. GROSSMITH, "we are doing <i>The Bells</i>. Mr. IRVING
  has kindly leased it to us. But we are not adhering too slavishly to the
  plot, nor does he wish us to; and, in fact, we have turned the part made
  so famous by Mr. IRVING'S father into something a shade more droll, to
  suit Mr. LESLIE HENSON, than whom, I take the liberty of
  thinking,"&mdash;here the young officer saluted&mdash;"no funnier
  comedian now walks the boards. We are also changing the title from <i>The
  Bells</i> to <i>The Belles</i>, as being more in keeping with Gaiety
  traditions. But I must ask you to excuse me; I fancy Sir DAVID BEATTY
  wants me."</p>

  <p>But the most interesting case of revision will be that of <i>The
  School for Scandal</i>, because, two managements being at work upon it,
  each with somewhat peculiar ideas, the public will be presented, at the
  same time, with versions so unlike as to amount to two different plays.
  And this suggests how valuable is Mr. IRVING'S lead, for it means that
  one old play can be multiplied into as many new plays as the thoroughly
  conscientious brains through which it passes. The two managers who have
  cast longing eyes on SHERIDAN'S comedy are Mr. SEYMOUR HICKS and Mr.
  OSCAR ASCHE. Mr. SEYMOUR HICKS is convinced that there is a new lease of
  life for this play if it is taken at a quicker pace. He has therefore
  arranged an acting version which will occupy about an hour, with laughs.
  By eliminating the word "sentiment" alone, which is tediously harped
  upon, several minutes are saved. Some of <i>Sir Peter</i> and <i>Lady
  Teazle's</i> repetition of the word "Never" also goes. The satirical
  conversation in Act I. is much abbreviated as being out of date, and the
  whole piece is redressed in the present manner. Mr. ASCHE also is
  re-dressing it, or rather un-dressing it. In his opinion what the play
  lacks is a touch of savagery. It is too sophisticated. He has therefore
  kept no more of the plot than is consistent with a change of scene to
  Hawaii, the fashionable primitive country of the moment. By this change,
  even if a little of the wit and spirit evaporate, a certain force is
  gained, a powerful epidermic part for Miss LILY BRAYTON as <i>Mrs.
  Candour</i> (the new heroine of the comedy) being not only possible but
  natural. Mr. ASCHE himself will play <i>Charles Surface</i>, with the
  accent on the surface, since he turns out to be a devotee of sun-baths
  and the simple life.</p>

<h2>THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>

<p class="center">LX.</p>

  <p>My dear CHARLES,&mdash;Those who insist that between the Higher
  Commands on either side there is a tacit understanding not to disregard
  each other's personal comfort and welfare must now modify their views.
  Recent movements show that there is no such bargain, or else that the
  lawless Hun has broken it. He has attained little else by his
  destructiveness save the discomfort of H.Q. Otherwise the War progresses
  as merrily as ever; more merrily, perhaps, owing to the difficulties to
  be overcome. Soldiers love difficulties to overcome. That is their
  business in life.</p>

  <p>It was open to the Camp Commandant, when it became likely that H.Q.
  would move, to go sick, to retire from business, or else, locking, his
  front-door, shutting his shutters, disconnecting his telephone and
  confining to their billets all potential bearers of urgent messages, to
  isolate himself from the throbbing world around him. Being a soldier
  himself, however, he was undone by his own innate lust for overcoming
  difficulties. He was seen hovering about, as good as asking for the
  instructions he most dreaded. And he got them, short and sharp, as all
  good military instructions should be.</p>

  <p>If I was called upon to move a busy community from one village to
  another, and if the other village was discovered, upon inquiry, not to be
  there, I should ask for ten to twelve months' time to do it in. The C.C.
  asked for a fortnight, hoping to get ten days; he got a week. "It is now
  the 31st. We should move to the new place about the 7th," said the
  Highest Authority. "Let it be April 7th." Thus April 7th became
  permanently and irrevocably fixed. For everybody except the C.C. and his
  accomplices the thing was as good as done.</p>

  <p>The ultimatum went forth at 10 A.M. at noon on the same day; the
  period of unrest for the C.C. was well set in. Every department, learning
  by instinct what was forward, forthwith discovered what it had long
  suspected, its own immediate and paramount importance. Every department
  appointed a representative to go round and see the C.C. about it, another
  representative to write to him about it, and a third to ring him up on
  the telephone, and go on ringing him up on the telephone, about it. The
  only departments that kept modestly in the background were those upon
  which the execution of the move fell. The C.C., noting the queue of
  representatives at his front-door and the agitation of his telephone,
  slipped out by the back-door, and went to look for the workers, and, when
  he'd found them, he lived with them, night and day, here, there and
  everywhere.</p>

  <p>Humanity is not constituted for such close friendships. As time passed
  the C.C. and his accomplices found relations becoming strained. They said
  things to each other which afterwards they regretted. Meanwhile also the
  departments with the paramount and immediate needs grew bitter and
  restless. Only the Highest Authorities remained tranquil.</p>

  <p>I'm told it was an A.D.C. who called attention to the difficulty of
  milk supply. This was a popular suggestion; it was just the sort of
  difficulty a soldier loves. In the bare and arid circumstances of the new
  camp there was no milk supply. "Buy one," said the Highest Authority, and
  again the thing was as good as done, except for the C.C., who had to
  think out a cow, so to speak, with regard to its purchase, equipment,
  transport, housing, maintenance and education. A man of infinite variety,
  the arrival of the cow (in bulk) found the C.C. nonplussed. He could not
  even begin to solve the food question. To him it seemed there were only
  two alternatives for the beast: bully beef or ration allowance at three
  francs a day in lieu of rations. The cow, he was told, was entitled and
  likely to refuse both.</p>

  <p>We all crowded round the C.C. to help. "As to a simple matter like
  food," said A. and Q., "the Lord will provide. But as to the more
  difficult and complicated matters of establishment we will issue your
  orders." These ran: "Reference COW: (1) This unit should be shown on your
  Weekly Strength Return, with a statement of all casualties affecting
  same. Casualties include admission to or evacuation from hospital; change
  of address; marriage, and leave to the United Kingdom. (2) To be brought
  on the proper establishment of H.Q., it should be shown as 'Officer's
  Charger, one,' and should be trained and employed by you as such. (3)
  Please report action taken, and whether by you or by the Cow."</p>

  <p>Even as the C.C. was contemplating this communication and hearkening
  to the cow grumbling away in his front-garden, his old regiment took
  occasion to march through the village and, in so doing, added insult to
  injury. The regiment had a mascot; the mascot was a goat; the goat fell
  out on the march and went sick. It did this in that portion of the C.C.'s
  front garden which was not already occupied by the cow, and its orders
  from the Colonel, who was its C.O. and had once been the Camp
  Commandant's C.O., were to remain with the C.C. and upon his charge till
  called for. This is all a very true story, but it's poor rations I'll be
  getting from the C.C. during what remains of this War for divulging
  it.</p>

  <p>Be anything in the military world you like, Charles, from a courtly
  General to a thrusting Loot in charge of some overwhelmingly important
  department or other, but do not be a Camp Commandant. As there is no
  terrible complication which may not occur in the life of such, so there
  is no bitter irony which may not follow all. The early afternoon of April
  6th found the C.C. on the site of the now camp, surrounded by confusion
  and an angry crowd of experts. There had been words and more words; there
  had only just not been blows, and all with regard to this wretched and
  incessant subject of April 7th. The C.C., never broad-minded on the
  point, had become positively ridiculous and tiresome about that
  irrevocable date, April 7th. It was a dull subject in any case, said the
  experts, but in the circumstances it was inane and cruel to go on
  insisting on it. R.E., Lorries, Signals and all their suites, not having
  been on too friendly terms among themselves these latter days, were fast
  becoming united in their intense loathing of the C.C. and his everlasting
  and impossible April 7th.</p>

  <p>At this moment the Highest Authority itself arrived on the scene to
  have a look at it. He was not in the least discontented with what he saw;
  he was inclined to congratulate the experts upon their expedition.</p>

  <p>"We shall be hard put to it, Sir," said the C.C., "to be ready for
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow?" said the Highest Authority. "Why to-morrow
  particularly?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow is the 7th, Sir," said the C.C., with sinister
  emphasis.</p>

  <p>"And what about it if it is?" asked the Highest Authority.</p>

  <p>"We have to move in here on April 7th, Sir," said the C.C., with
  almost an injured note in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Have you?" said the Highest Authority. "Why?"</p>

  <p>The experts saluted and moved off, commenting quietly among themselves
  upon the good sense and magnanimity of the Highest Authority. As for that
  Camp Commandant&mdash;</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

  <p><i>Monday, April 23rd.</i>&mdash;Any intelligent foreigner who
  obtained admission to the Distinguished Strangers' Gallery in the
  expectation that on the feast-day of our national saint and the birthday
  of our national poet he would be privileged to listen to a series of
  eloquent speeches upon patriotism, delivered by our most accomplished
  orators, must have been deeply disappointed. The one subject that the
  House of Commons seems to care about is food.</p>

  <p>The CONTROLLER has hit one section of the House in its tenderest
  portion. Those Members who make their mid-day meal off tea and
  bread-and-butter think it very hard that they should be allowed no more
  bread than others who take the full luncheon. On their behalf Mr. LONDON,
  like <i>The Carpenter</i>, said, "Give us another slice." But, despite a
  slight facial resemblance to <i>The Walrus</i>, Colonel LOCKWOOD was
  inexorable.</p>

  <p>The late Mr. JUSTIN MCCARTHY was once described by his ex-leader as "a
  nice old gentleman for a quiet tea-party." If anyone had said that a
  Sunday-School treat would furnish the appropriate <i>milieu</i> for that
  ardent Pacifist, Mr. JOWETT, I should, until this afternoon, have been
  inclined to agree with him. But it is evident that his acquaintance with
  Sunday-School treats is purely academic, for in requesting the FOOD
  CONTROLLER to remove the ban lately placed upon them he spoke of the
  treat as a "simple meal, consisting of <i>a</i> bun and tea only." The
  italic is our own comment on this estimate of the capacity of our brave
  tea-fighters.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, April 24th.</i>&mdash;Those Members to whom their
  constituents have given notice to quit at the next election, and who have
  recently been somewhat depressed by the thought of the impending loss to
  the nation of their valuable services, are plucking up heart again now
  that the life of Parliament is to be once more extended. Mr. KING, for
  example, was in his best form this afternoon. It goes without saying that
  his advice to the Board of Agriculture to set a good example to the
  country by sending their racehorses out to grass was well received, for
  any reference to the Government stud is equivalent to the "Pass the
  mustard" of the established humourist. His real success came when Mr.
  BONAR LAW denied that Sir GEORGE MCCRAE had been appointed Chief Whip to
  the Government. Mr. KING drawled out, "As <i>The Times</i> has stated
  that this gentleman was so appointed will its foreign circulation be
  stopped?" Then the laughter came spontaneous and loud.</p>

  <p>Another little joke which tickled the House was, I suspect, the
  outcome of a conspiracy. At least I cannot understand why Mr. OUTHWAITE
  should have been so anxious to know the amount of ginger imported into
  this country last year, unless it was to afford Mr. MACVEAGH an
  opportunity of asking, when the amount, some three thousand tons, had
  been announced, "How is it that the new Government has got none of
  it?"</p>

  <p>There is a growing tendency on the part of Ministers, when charged
  with the conduct of a Bill, to speak of it as "a poor thing not mine
  own." They imagine, I suppose, that an air of deprecation, not to say
  depreciation, is likely to commend the measure to an audience in which
  party-spirit is supposed to be defunct.</p>

    <p>VISCOUNT CHAPLIN MAKING NOTES ON THE MILLENNIUM FROM THE PEERS'
    GALLERY.</p>
  </div>
  <p>At first it seemed as if Mr. PROTHERO, in moving the second reading of
  the Corn Production Bill, was going to adopt the modern attitude of
  <i>insouciance</i>, for he spoke of it as "bristling with controversial
  points" (as if it were intended to promote the growth of quite another
  kind of corn), and observed that he himself had originally been opposed
  to State interference with agriculture. But he soon warmed to his work,
  and spoke with all the zeal of the convert. Among his most appreciative
  listeners were the occupants of the Peers' Gallery&mdash;the Duke of
  MARLBOROUGH, who has transformed the sword of Blenheim into a
  ploughshare, and Viscount CHAPLIN, to whom the announcement of State
  bounties for wheat-growing seems like the arrival of the Millennium.</p>

  <p>Another ex-Minister of Agriculture was, to put it mildly, less
  enthusiastic. I should be doing Mr. RUNCIMAN little injustice to say that
  for the moment the politician in him rose superior to the patriot. If
  after the War the old party-quarrels are to break out again with all
  their fatal futility I can imagine that Liberal wire-pullers in the rural
  districts will be much embarrassed by the existence of bounties which
  economically they cannot approve but which politically they dare not
  remove. But surely we shall have learned our lesson badly if the old
  strife of Tory and Liberal is to be revived in all its former virulence
  and sterility. Besides there is the Labour Party to be considered, as Mr.
  GEORGE ROBERTS reminded the House in the best speech he has made since he
  went <span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg
  291]</span> on the Treasury Bench. He pointed out that if high wages and
  good conditions were to be secured for agricultural workers the
  prosperity of the agricultural industry as a whole must be ensured; and
  he hoped that the policy of State-aid would not stop there. No wonder the
  hard-shell Free Traders looked glum.</p>

  <p>Sir HEDWORTH MEUX must be careful or he will jeopardize his reputation
  as a humourist. Mr. PARTINGTON having asked whether the Government would
  put down their racehorses, the gallant Admiral could think of no better
  jest than that the proposal was as futile as that of the hon. Member's
  namesake, who endeavoured to keep out the Atlantic with a mop. Shortly
  afterwards Mr. YEO asked whether the Government would consider the
  destruction of cats, with a view, perhaps, to the suppression of
  MEUX.</p>

  <p>The Corn Production Bill had to run the gauntlet of a good many
  criticisms during the second day's debate. The unkindest cut of all was
  delivered by the SPEAKER. Mr. MOLTENO had asked whether Members who were
  landowners or farmers might vote on a measure affecting their financial
  interests, and Mr. LOWTHER replied that the benefits were "so
  problematical and so uncertain" that he thought they might. Mr. MOLTENO
  used his freedom to vote against the Second Reading; but only a handful
  of Members followed his example. Mr. RUNCIMAN and his friends decided
  that abstention was the better part of valour.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, April 26th.</i>&mdash;Major BAIRD made a modest and
  candid defence of the Air Board against its many critics. He did not
  pretend that they were yet satisfied&mdash;in the case of so new a
  service there could be no finality&mdash;but he claimed that the
  departments had worked much more harmoniously since they were all housed
  under the hospitable roof of the Hotel Cecil, a statement which Lord HUGH
  of that ilk subsequently endorsed. Major BAIRD, despite the general
  mildness of his voice and demeanour, can deliver a good hard knock on
  occasion. He warned the House against indulging in a certain class of
  criticism, on the ground that there was no surer way of killing an airman
  than to destroy his confidence in the machine he was flying; and he
  asserted that the "mastery of the air" was a meaningless phrase
  impossible of realization. I think Mr. PEMBERTON-HICKS and Mr.
  JOYNSON-BILLING took the rebuke to heart, for they were much less
  aggressive than usual.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center">"HAMLET."</p>

  <p>To prepare a very own version of <i>Hamlet</i> and play it with
  credit&mdash;that is still the blue riband of the Stage. Mr. H.B. IRVING
  has fairly won it. The version seemed to me apt. He tells us that his
  main purpose was to bring out the story as if for those who had never
  seen the play before. It is a rational point of view, and certainly it
  seemed a distinct improvement not to lose sight of <i>Hamlet's</i>
  adventure to England, as is commonly the case, and to keep the essential
  sequence of events and the personality of the Prince constantly before
  the audience. The justification of the heroic cuts and adaptations was
  that the action did move faster towards the tragic end, instead of
  seeming to drag rather tiresomely as (be it confessed) it sometimes
  does.</p>

    <p class="center">(We shouldn't have guessed it, but his own mother
    ought to know.)</p>

    <p class="center"><i>Hamlet</i> . . . . . . . MR. H.B. IRVING.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Observers contrasting this with Mr. IRVING'S earlier performance
  remarked a gain in depth and fire and a happier restraint of mannerism.
  It was a very notable and gracious piece of work. He has the player's
  first gift, an arresting personality. His elocution has distinction. He
  conveys the beauty of the words and the richness of the packed thought
  thoughtfully. The complex play of action and motive&mdash;the purpose
  blunted by overmuch thinking, the spurs to dull revenge, the
  self-contempt, the assumed antic disposition, at times the real mental
  disturbance&mdash;all this was set before us with a fine skill and
  resource. The "To be or not to be" soliloquy was masterly in its
  sincerity and restraint; the two broken love passages with <i>Ophelia</i>
  showed a fine tenderness through the distraught, bitter mood. An
  ingenious turn was given to that difficult change of weapons in the
  fencing bout, though I doubt if the Sword Club would wholly have approved
  the technique of the fencing.</p>

  <p>Miss GERTRUDE ELLIOTT'S <i>Ophelia</i> in the Mad Scene was full of
  beauty, sweetness and dignity&mdash;and we have so often been bored by
  our lesser <i>Ophelias</i>. A very fine performance. Mr. HOLMAN CLARK was
  the foolish prating knave, a <i>Polonius</i> robbed of his best speech,
  and the more consistent therefore. Mr. IRVING is obviously right in his
  view that <i>Polonius</i> could never by any chance have given any such
  advice to his truculent son.</p>

  <p>One may congratulate the producer on the courage of his convictions.
  But I wonder if the Shakspearean tradition is really dying. The general
  quality of the performance was, it must be confessed, not inspiring.
  There was little of the king's divinity hedging <i>Claudius</i>; the
  <i>Queen</i> (an always difficult part) was elaborately unconvincing,
  though played by a clever actress; <i>Guildenstern</i> and awkward
  <i>Rosencrantz</i> deserved any fate which awaited them in England.
  Neither <i>Laertes</i> nor <i>Horatio</i> seemed authentic. But Mr. TOM
  REYNOLDS' grave-digger had humour and avoided tedium. <i>Hamlet</i> was
  the thing.</p>

<h2>THE ADJUTANT ON LEAVE.</h2>

  <p>"Leave, I'm afraid," remarked the Adjutant, standing with his back to
  the fire and hitching his bath towel more securely over his left
  shoulder, "can only be granted now in special circumstances."</p>

  <p>Flying being prevented for that afternoon by the weather conditions,
  we had been playing hockey, and the Adjutant, who by virtue of seniority
  had just had first go at the bathroom, was in a warm and expansive mood.
  The rest of us sat about in his quarters awaiting our turns at a
  hot-water supply that would certainly cease to have anything warming or
  expansive about it by the time it reached the junior Second
  Lieutenant.</p>

  <p>"The question is," said that dejected officer, fixing the Adjutant
  with a watchful eye&mdash;"the question is, what are you going to regard
  as special circumstances?"</p>

  <p>"You state your circumstances to me officially to-morrow," said the
  Adjutant cheerfully, "and I'll tell you quickly enough whether they're
  special or not,"</p>

  <p>"I suppose," suggested the Stunt Pilot, "that a wedding would be a
  pretty special sort of circumstance, wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>"That depends," replied the Adjutant. "Are you thinking of getting
  married yourself?"</p>

  <p>The Stunt Pilot said that he hadn't been, but if there was any leave
  going with it he might think of it.</p>

  <p>"One's simply got to get leave <i>somehow</i>," he complained. "What
  about a breach of promise case? Suppose I manage to get mixed up in a
  breach of promise case, wouldn't that do?"</p>

  <p>"That's no good," commented the Junior Officer gloomily. "You'd have
  to get leave for something else first before you could manage it."</p>

  <p>"And if you did," added the Adjutant severely, "you'd get leave for
  rather longer than you bargained for."</p>

  <p>"How about funerals?" put in the Equipment Officer hopefully.
  "Funerals are a fairly sound stunt, aren't they?"</p>

  <p>"Funerals," observed the Adjutant, "are played out. If you come to me
  to-morrow and talk about dead uncles and things I shall have all sorts of
  inquiries made that will surprise you. I've been had before by funerals.
  When I was in the Army"&mdash;the Adjutant talks like this since he was
  attached to the Flying Corps&mdash;"when <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg 293]</span> I was in the Army there
  was a fellow who used to come to the orderly-room and talk funerals to me
  until I was sick of the sight of him. After some months of it I made him
  give me a written list of all his surviving relations, and then as he
  killed them off I used to scratch them out. I caught him at last on his
  third grandmother."</p>

  <p>"That's all very nice," said the Stunt Pilot, "but the question at
  present before the meeting is how are we poor beggars to get any
  leave?"</p>

  <p>"It's no good blaming me," returned the Adjutant blandly. "Command
  Orders are Command Orders."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence, and then the Stunt Pilot lifted up his
  voice and spoke eloquently about the War Office and Brass Hats generally.
  He said that they had hearts of granite and were strangers to all
  loving-kindness. Their days were spent in idleness in the Metropolis (so
  said the Stunt Pilot), while he and his fellows drove rotten 'buses for
  hours together over the beastliest district in Europe. Of an evening the
  Carlton and the Piccadilly, the Bing Boys and the Bing Girls, all the
  delights of London were ready to their hands, while poor devils like
  himself, shorn of leave, were condemned to languish in a moth-eaten Mess
  in the society of such people as the Adjutant. Where was the sense in it,
  where the justice, and when the deuce were they, any of them, going to
  get a chance at the bath-room?</p>

  <p>The Adjutant regarded him with amused pity.</p>

  <p>"The fact of it is," he observed, "you people have been absolutely
  spoilt over leave. When I was in the Infantry we used to consider three
  or four days in six months quite handsome."</p>

  <p>The Stunt Pilot inquired sarcastically whether he meant three or four
  days' work or three or four days' leave.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind saying," pursued the Adjutant, ignoring this sally, "at
  the risk of making myself unpopular, that personally I think it's a very
  good thing that leave <i>has</i> been cut down. My own opinion is that in
  the past there's been a lot too much leave flying about. Running up and
  down to London on leave isn't going to help beat the Germans. What we've
  got to do if we want to win this War is to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At this moment the C.O. entered and put down a hockey-stick in the
  corner.</p>

  <p>"Thanks for the stick, Jervis," he said, and turned to go. "By the
  way, shall I see you at the orderly-room tomorrow before you go? What
  train are you catching?"</p>

  <p>The Adjutant hesitated for the fraction of a second.</p>

  <p>"Well, Sir," he said, "I thought of taking the 9.5."</p>

  <p>"I see," said the C.O. "Right-o. You won't be away longer than
  forty-eight hours, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," said the Adjutant. "That'll do well, Sir."</p>

  <p>A brief astonished silence followed the C.O.'s departure, a silence
  broken by the excited tones of the Stunt Pilot.</p>

  <p>"The 9.5?" he cried. "Are you going to <i>London</i>?"</p>

  <p>The Adjutant lit a cigarette with some deliberation.</p>

  <p>"Only just for forty-eight hours," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Forty-eight hours!" gasped the indignant Pilot; then, raising his
  voice to surmount the din, "Forty-eight hours' leave in London, and
  you've just been pouring out hot air about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Leave?</i>" interrupted the Adjutant, in pained surprise. "What
  d'you mean by leave? I'm going on <i>duty</i>."</p>

  <p>A chorus of derisive laughter greeted <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg 294]</span> the announcement. "Duty?"
  echoed the Stunt Pilot bitterly. "<i>What</i> duty?"</p>

  <p>The Adjutant took another furl in his bath-towel.</p>

  <p>"If you really must know," he said composedly, "I'm going to buy a
  vacuum-cleaner for the Mess."</p>

  <p>"You infernal old wangler!" cried the outraged Pilot, when at last he
  was able to make himself heard. "Of course it takes forty-eight hours to
  buy a vacuum-cleaner, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," said the Adjutant solemnly, "my whole
  experience of vacuum-cleaners leads me to the conviction that you have to
  look at a great many of them before you can pick a really good one." He
  glanced round for his clothes. "And now if you fellows will get on with
  your baths, I've got an air mechanic coming in a minute or two to cut my
  hair. I expect I shall be far too busy in town for the next two days to
  have any time to waste on barbers."</p>

<h2>GENERAL POST.</h2>

  <p>Everything was just as usual. I caught my tram at the corner of the
  street. It was the six o'clock car&mdash;I noticed the usual evening
  crowd, and they were all as bored and cross and frigid as usual.</p>

  <p>The old gentleman of the whiskers was, as usual, reading his evening
  paper. He looked personally affronted as I sat down beside him. The
  elderly relative&mdash;as I call her&mdash;was opposite to me. She had
  her small attaché-case and her knitting as usual, and she made me feel at
  a glance that my face bored her intolerably. For the rest, I saw the fat
  paterfamilias, the wish-I-had-a-motor lady, the pert flapper and all the
  crew who travel with dejected spirits to and fro on our suburban
  line.</p>

  <p>So far all was in order. Then the conductress came round.</p>

  <p>"Tuppenny," I murmured. "Albemarle Road."</p>

  <p>"What's your town?" she asked, taking a pencil from behind her
  ear.</p>

  <p>"Town? It's Albemarle Road I want."</p>

  <p>"But what town do you choose for Post?" she asked. "You've all got to
  have a town, you know. Don't make it too long. Hurry up! I've got to
  write you all down, and it's time to begin."</p>

  <p>"Pontresina," I gasped wildly. That seemed to be the only town I had
  ever heard of.</p>

  <p>"And you, Sir?" she was asking the old gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Macclesfield," he said very decidedly.</p>

  <p>The elderly relative was fidgeting to say hers. I could have guessed
  it would be St. Ives.</p>

  <p>The conductress made her way from one end to the other.</p>

  <p>"All got towns?" she asked. "You, Sir? Pernambuco? I do wish you'd
  stick to English names. Are you all ready?"</p>

  <p>She rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"Now," she said, "the gentleman on the stool has to catch. The Post is
  going from Paris to Pontresina."</p>

  <p>I rose and looked wildly down the car. The flapper was beckoning
  slightly. Her contemptuous boredom had vanished, and she looked a merry
  child again. I rushed, stumbled, rocked into her place; she sank with a
  gasp into mine.</p>

  <p>"York to St. Ives!"</p>

  <p>It was the paterfamilias who was up now, and the elderly relative was
  signing to him. In a breathless scurry she was in his place gasping
  beside me. For the first time in her life she spoke to me.</p>

  <p>"What an escape!" she said. "There, <i>he'</i>s caught&mdash;York, I
  mean. I don't know his proper name. It's odd, isn't it, we know each
  other's faces so well and yet we don't know each other's names. Now that
  we have towns for names, it will be far more friendly, won't it? I always
  called you Cicero to myself. Oh, I hardly know why&mdash;you looked a
  little satirical sometimes. But now you're Pontresina, of course."</p>

  <p>"Macclesfield to Pernambuco!"</p>

  <p>"There!" laughed my companion. "I knew Macclesfield would be
  caught&mdash;he's so stately, isn't he? But look how he's laughing. Do
  you know I never thought any of the people in this car <i>could</i>
  laugh, or even smile. I do think this Society for the Abolition of
  Boredom in Public Conveyances is an excellent thing, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Pontresina to St. Ives!"</p>

  <p>Breathlessly we changed places; her black hat was a little crooked,
  but she only laughed.</p>

  <p>"I've lost my knitting, too," she said, "but I don't mind. This
  exercise keeps one so warm these cold days."</p>

  <p>The game was in wild progress; the car rocked and jolted and the
  conductress shouted the names.</p>

  <p>"General Post!" she called. "Those inside change places with those
  outside."</p>

  <p>That was the most breathlessly exciting moment of the whole game.
  There was a solid struggling mass of humanity on the tram staircase.
  Those without were pushing frantically to come down; we were shoving to
  get up.</p>

  <p>The lady called St. Ives was thumping my shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Climb up the railing," she said.</p>

  <p>Somehow I did it, and leaned down to catch her hands and drag her
  upwards. We launched ourselves breathlessly on to the furthest seat.</p>

  <p>Stout old Macclesfield was the next. He had lost his hat and his white
  hair was ruffled.</p>

  <p>"I'm here," he said. "Macclesfield for ever!"</p>

  <p>The flapper had scrambled up the front staircase against the rules.
  She cast herself down beside Macclesfield.</p>

  <p>"Here I am, old dear," she exclaimed. "I left York simply
  <i>jammed</i> in the wedge. Oh, isn't it fun? I never laughed so much. We
  never <i>can</i> be serious with each other after this, can we?"</p>

  <p>St. Ives nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'll never forget Pontresina climbing the rail," she said. "I used to
  think him so haughty; now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Albemarle Road&mdash;don't you want Albemarle Road?" the conductress
  was asking me. She spoke very loudly.</p>

  <p>"Pontresina&mdash;I'm Pontresina," I answered.</p>

  <p>"This is Albemarle Road. If you're going on it'll be another penny,"
  she insisted.</p>

  <p>I rose in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>St. Ives was looking at me while she knitted. I raised my hat to her
  and smiled. We had been such good friends all the evening&mdash;how could
  I ever forget it? But she did not smile; she only stared. She seemed to
  think I was mad. Macclesfield was reading his <i>Star</i> just as if he
  had never hurled himself on to the top of the 'bus. The flapper <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg 295]</span> was

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>I have the feeling that when Mr. RUDYARD KIPLING called his new volume
  <i>A Diversity of Creatures</i> (MACMILLAN) he was rather taking the word
  out of my mouth, or the sword out of my hand, or whatever one does for
  the confusion and discomforting of critics. Because it is just the
  extreme diversity of the tales herein which, while providing (as they
  say) something for all tastes, makes it very hard to appraise the book as
  a whole. In form it follows the KIPLING convention, endeared to us by so
  much pleasure, of sandwiching prose and verse, the poems echoing the idea
  of the tale that has preceded them, and themselves likely to prove for
  many the most attractive pages of the book. As for the stories, here we
  get diversity indeed; and not of theme alone. It is, of course, almost
  impossible for anything signed by Mr. KIPLING to be wholly commonplace,
  but I am bound to admit that there is at least one of the collection
  (which, pardon me, I do not mean to name) that makes a notable effort in
  that direction. Also there are two of which one can honestly say that no
  other pen could have written them with anything like such finished
  art&mdash;<i>The Village that Voted the Earth was Flat</i>, which one
  might call a fantasia upon Publicity, and (to my mind the best thing in
  the volume) <i>My Son's Wife</i>, an exquisitely humorous and cunning
  study in the Influence of Landed Estate upon a Modern. If this definition
  strikes you as obscure, read the story and you will understand. For the
  rest, as I said above, all tastes are catered for; so that the rival
  schools who admire Mr. KIPLING most as the creator of <i>Plain Tales</i>,
  or <i>Stalky</i> or <i>Puck</i>, will each receive encouragement and
  support; while, if there be those who prefer the pot-boiler
  undisguisable, they too will not find themselves altogether
  neglected.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I do wish our publishers would grasp the great truth that praise of
  their own wares needs (to say the least of it) most careful handling.
  What they, or some anonymous admirer, say on the cover of <i>The Worn
  Doorstep</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) is that they should like to shout its
  merits from the housetop. Possibly; but let me protest that it is for me,
  and not for them, to do the shouting, if any; which said, I will proceed
  to admit that the book is one of considerable charm. It is told in the
  form of letters (never to be posted, since they are from a young wife to
  her soldier-husband, presumed to have been killed before the opening of
  the book). Miss MARGARET SHERWOOD thus reverts to a convention more
  popular some few years ago than with our present-day romanticists. The
  matter of her tale shows how the young wife in question found consolation
  in befriending others, especially in the love affairs of a Belgian
  refugee couple, to whom she opens her home and heart. A very pretty idea,
  developed with many dainty and amiable touches. Perhaps (I set down no
  dogmatic verdict on the point) the cynical or impatient may find its
  sweetness something too drawn out. On the other hand, there are many
  "gentle readers," probably a vast majority, to whom its appeal will prove
  entirely successful. And as they can be trusted to spread its merits in
  the right quarters there will be no need for the publishers to shout,
  either from the house-top or anywhere else, which (as I suggested above)
  is as it should be.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>When we are introduced to <i>Margaret Grenfield</i>, the heroine of
  <i>Fetters on the Feet</i> (ARNOLD), she is living with some Quaker
  cousins and spending most of her time in mending stockings. So many
  people make stockings who refuse absolutely to mend them that I imagine
  there must be something peculiarly unattractive in this work of
  restoration, and it was a fortunate day for <i>Margaret</i> when the
  pedantic young man of the house proposed to marry her. After this we
  discover that she has both a history and a will of her own. She leaves
  the Quakers, and goes as secretary to a lady who holds eccentric if
  broadminded views on every conceivable subject, and the change of
  atmosphere, however delightful in various ways, was too much for
  <i>Margaret's</i> peace of mind. The young Quaker was an obstinate wooer
  and followed her up, but his chances of success, which were never rosy,
  grew dimmer and dimmer as <i>Margaret</i>, freeing herself of shackles,
  gradually began to see life as a whole instead of through the eye of a
  darning-needle. In the end MRS. FRED REYNOLDS tells us that "the day
  dawned. The whole earth sang and sparkled in the glad light of it," which
  is her way of saying that <i>Margaret</i> had found happiness. But all
  the same I fancy that introspection had become such a habit of this
  heroine that she is still likely to have days when the dawn is grey and
  no birds sing.</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
